<h2 id="choosing-the-right-program">Choosing the Right Program</h2>

<p>Math/CS technically encompasses 4 degrees: Math and Computer Science, Honours Math and Computer Science, Statistics and Computer Science, and Honours Statistics and Computer Science. There's a lot of overlap between the courses, and first year classes for the four degrees are almost the exact same so if you're on the fence you can try taking the honours versions of the few courses where the programs diverge and see how you find it. Honours programs tend to be more demanding and theoretical. They're intended to prepare the student for graduate school, and honours courses require more time than their majors equivalents. Although honours students get priority in signing up for honours courses, students in majors programs can also register for honours courses.</p>

<p>No matter what program you choose within the joint math and computer science family, COMP 250, COMP 273, COMP 206, and MATH 235 will all be required. In first semester, the only courses where you'll need to choose between the honours and majors version will be analysis (and even then, the math department lets students who took majors analysis 1 enroll in honours analysis 2) and possibly advanced calculus or probability if you choose to enrol in them in U1. If you're on the fence between enroling in math/cs and pure cs, it's worth noting that MATH 235 or MATH 242 can be substituted for MATH 240 to satisfy prerequisites.</p>

<p>The difference between a stats/cs degree and a math/cs degree is fairly small. The two programs diverge in upper level courses, with math/cs students getting slightly more freedom in their math course selections and stats/cs students restricted mainly to statistics-related courses. A math/cs student is required to take higher-level analysis and algebra courses but has some open credits and can use their math complementaries to take statistics courses, but a statistics/cs student will have a hard time replacing stats courses with, say, topology. Taking probability early in your degree will give you an idea of whether you want to go the stats route and also opens the door to taking upper-level machine learning/artificial intelligence/natural language processing courses.</p>

<h2 id="why-math-and-cs">Why Math and CS?</h2>

<p>Lots of things! A degree in math and computer science can come in handy in a huge variety of industries. Graduates have gone on to work for tech companies like Google, finance companies like Morgan Stanley, and universities like McGill (Henri Darmon is a math prof who graduated from McGill with an honours math and computer science degree).</p>

<h2 id="surviving-math-cs">Surviving Math and CS</h2>

<p>The advantage of doing a joint program is that there are lots of different resources available from both departments! Burnside 911 is a great resource for math course help, Trottier 3rd floor is home to the CS Help Desk for your computer science courses, and both the Mathematics and Statistics and Computer Science departments offer a wide variety of cool talks and colloquia, including the following:</p>

<p>CS department colloquia: check the Computer Science Undergraduate listserv for a heads up on when the next talks are in SOCS.</p>
